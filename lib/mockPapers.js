      'XQ-100 has produced and made publicly available an homogeneous and high-quality\n' +
      'sample of echelle spectra of 100 QSOs at redshifts z~3.5-4.5 observed with full\n' +
      'spectral coverage from 315 to 2500 nm at a resolving power ranging from R~4000\n' +
      'to 7000, depending on wavelength. The median signal-to-noise ratios are 33, 25\n' +
      'and 43, as measured at rest-frame wavelengths 1700, 3000 and 3600 Angstrom,\n' +
      'respectively. This paper provides future users of XQ-100 data with the basic\n' +
      'statistics of the survey, along with details of target selection, data\n' +
      'acquisition and data reduction. The paper accompanies the public release of all\n' +
      'data products, including 100 reduced spectra. XQ-100 is the largest\n' +
      'spectroscopic survey to date of high-redshift QSOs with simultaneous rest-frame\n' +
      'UV/optical coverage, and as such enables a wide range of extragalactic\n' +
      'research, from cosmology and galaxy evolution to AGN astrophysics.',
